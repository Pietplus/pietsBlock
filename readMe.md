This code was provided by https://dev.to/freakcdev297/creating-a-blockchain-in-60-lines-of-javascript-5fka
and is open-source licensed.

To learn some basics about the blockchain i wrote the code by myself inetead of copying it and inspected the single functions.

Actually i failed to run the blockchain, i have to refactor the code.

Lets have some breakfast! :)
